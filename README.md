# Python-Practicals-
## practical 1: WAP to find the roots of a quadratic equation .

a = int (input("Enterthe value: "))
b = int (input("Enterthe value: "))
c = int (input("Enterthe value: "))

d = b**2-4*a*c 

    r1 = (-b + (d)**/2*a
    r2 = (-b -(d)**0.5)/2*a
if d>=0:
print("The roots are real",r1,r2)
else:
print("The roots are not real")
   

## Practical 2:
Program 2. WAP to accept a number 'n' to compute the following:

a. Check if 'n' is prime or not. Code neval(input("enter value ")) if n>1: for i in range(2,n); if n % 10: print(n, "not a prime number") break

else: print(n, "prime number") else: print(n, "not a prime number ")

Output = enter value 1 1 not a prime number enter value 29 29 prime number

b. Generate all prime numbers till 'n' Code eval(input("enter value")) for num in range(1,n): if num > 1: for i in range (2, num): if num % i == 0: break

else: print(num, end=',')

Output enter value 100 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73,79,83,89,97,

# program 11
## Consider a tuple t1 = (1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) . WAP to perform following
oprations:
(a.) Print half the values of the tuple in one line and other half in the other next line. 
(b.) Print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple.
(c.) concatenate a tuple t2 = (11, 13, 15) with t1.
(d.) Return maximmum and minimum from this given tuple.
