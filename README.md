# Python-Practicals-
## practical 1: WAP to find the roots of a quadratic equation .

a = int (input("Enterthe value: "))
b = int (input("Enterthe value: "))
c = int (input("Enterthe value: "))

d = b**2-4*a*c 

    r1 = (-b + (d)**/2*a
    r2 = (-b -(d)**0.5)/2*a
if d>=0:
print("The roots are real",r1,r2)
else:
print("The roots are not real")
   

## Practical 2:
Program 2. WAP to accept a number 'n' to compute the following:

a. Check if 'n' is prime or not. Code neval(input("enter value ")) if n>1: for i in range(2,n); if n % 10: print(n, "not a prime number") break

else: print(n, "prime number") else: print(n, "not a prime number ")

Output = enter value 1 1 not a prime number enter value 29 29 prime number

b. Generate all prime numbers till 'n' Code eval(input("enter value")) for num in range(1,n): if num > 1: for i in range (2, num): if num % i == 0: break

else: print(num, end=',')

Output enter value 100 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73,79,83,89,97,
